\chapter{Abstract}

A smart contract is a program running on a blockchain platform.
Businesses often use it as a signed contract or an agreement to regulate the stakeholders
because smart contracts reduce the need in trusted intermediators, arbitrations, and enforcement costs.
Since there are existing conventional applications running business logic,
it is ideal to transform these applications to smart contracts.

Due the properties of blockchains and smart contracts, we do not think all conventional applications can be safely transformed to smart contracts.
Thus in this paper we propose to identify the patterns of conventional applications and tell which is transformable.
Then we implement algorithms to transform these applications to smart contracts.
