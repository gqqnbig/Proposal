\section{Schedules}


\begin{description}
   \item[July 2021]  I've submitted a paper on diff classification.
   \item[March 2022] At present, I'm working on smart contract generation and going to write a conference paper. I plan to submit the paper on March 2022.
   \item[December 2022]  Next, I will work on the theory part of smart contract. The paper may focus on refinement calculus and use pre-order or partial order in theory proofs. I plan to submit the paper on December 2022.
   \item[April 2023] Finally I shall commence writing my doctoral thesis and submit it on April 2023.
